Book of Love formed in Philadelphia, PA, by former art school students Susan Ottaviano (vocals), Ted Ottaviano (keyboards, vocals), Jade Lee (keyboards, vocals), and Lauren Roselli (keyboards, vocals) in 1984. (Although they share the same last name, Susan and Ted are not related nor are they married to one another.) Susan, Ted, and Lee had initially collaborated in a band called Head Cheese. In 1985, Book of Love recorded “Boy,“ a toe-tapping tale of teen-girl angst. The song was given to DJ Ivan Ivan, who then forwarded it to Sire Records president Seymour Stein. Impressed, Stein signed Book of Love to the label. “Boy“ became a hit on the college and dance charts, with “I Touch Roses“ subsequently hitting number one on the latter.

After the release of ”Visions”, they quickly followed with the tropical-tinged ”Don‘t Say No” (featuring Dresses), ”Senses” (featuring Lostboycrow), and ”Adventure” (featuring Evan Wartner). As they gained exposure on social media and spins on streaming services (over 55 million on Spotify, plus 15 million on YouTube), they joined the Chainsmokers on tour. Successive singles continued to drop into 2016, when they unveiled ”Sex” (featuring Kris Kross Amsterdam), which borrowed the sentiment and chorus from the Salt-N- Pepa classic ”Let‘s Talk About Sex.”",

Born in Miami and then later relocating to Los Angeles, Borger began recording in early 2000s; playing around with various musical styles, he settled on dance music as his preferred genre. His tracks “From Cali with Love,“ “Rags to Riches,“ “GANGSTEROUS,“ and “Aggro“ soon garnered attention from the EDM-oriented community and gave Borger a platform for further releases on the labels Spinnin' and Doorn. It was the track “Tsunami“ -- his collaboration with electronic duo DVBBS -- that gained him worldwide recognition. The song was an international smash and led him to perform at major electronic music festivals around the world in 2013. He and DVBBS teamed up with Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike for the single “Stampede“ on Spinnin' in late 2013 and he also signed with the label at the same time. In 2014, U.K. rapper Tinie Tempah contributed vocals to “Tsunami“ in an updated remix version of the song. In spring 2014, he released the single “Invincible“ which proved to another popular hit for the producer. - Aneet Nijjar, Rovi via Wikipedia",

After the albums G Spot (1993) and Ginger (1995), as techno developed into a dominating force on many dance floors worldwide, Jochem Paap chose to pursue other exciting avenues. On Public Energy No. 1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) the sound wizard exchanged flowing, harmonious techno for a much more complex formula filled with colliding samples, crackling rhythms and tremendously thrilling turns.<br>Not one to be pigeonholed, over the years he has collaborated with video-artists and filmmakers, making the pioneering DVD Umfeld — an audio-visual electronic trip, which set the standard for many surround-sound composers. Meanwhile his boutique label, Electric Deluxe, has provided a platform for artists to explore more left-field techno projects and experiment with the ever-expanding technological possibilities of modern music making. As an extension of the label its sister event series, Electric Deluxe Presents, has turned Speedy J’s musical vision and penchant for innovation into a premier clubbing experience.<br>Recently the esteemed producer and performer has teamed up with with Stroboscopic Artefacts boss Lucy to form Zeitgeber. In 2013 the pair released their eponymous debut album to critical acclaim.<br>As a DJ, Speedy J is still as busy as ever, touching down in the most important venues and festivals worldwide every weekend.
