With their Spotify and SoundCloud streams now exceeding 70 million and with twenty-three #1’s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America.</br></br>Kicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Alesso, and Tori Kelly to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct “Soul House” style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the “Award of Independent Excellence” from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey’s hit “Born To Die” scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014.</br></br>Following multiple performances at San Francisco’s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York’s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Spain, Denmark, The Bahamas, and Mexico, showing off their potential in the international arena.</br></br>With support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2017, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.",

They issued the Daft Punk-meets-dubstep single “Michael Jackson (The Beat Goes On)“ in 2012, later included on the EP The Beat Goes On. The band signed to Atlantic‘s Big Beat subsidiary one year later. Their first single for the label, “Take Me Home,“ featuring Bebe Rexha, followed in July 2013. The hit was part of the Overtime EP, which also featured Kerli on the track “Here and Now.“ The following year, Cash Cash nabbed head Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik for the single “Lightning.“ “Surrender“ arrived the year later with American singer Julia Michaels on vocals. These songs would later feature on their fourth LP -- and first for Big Beat -- Blood, Sweat & 3 Years. The 2016 release featured additional contributions from artists such as Busta Rhymes, Fitz & the Tantrums, Nelly, Christina Perri, and more.

Previous tours stops have been absolutely killer, packing the venues with infectious dance music, and it's sure to be a zoo on Thursday.<br></br>Elephante is the recording and performing moniker of Tim Wu, a Los Angeles-based EDM DJ/producer known for his big-room progressive house anthems and remixes of artists ranging from Clean Bandit to Lorde. He generally tends to produce pop-leaning vocal dance tracks, but he dips into slower, trap-inspired numbers as well. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1989, Wu began playing music at an early age, receiving classical piano training before teaching himself to play guitar. He graduated from Harvard University in 2011 and initially tried to break into the music business as an acoustic singer/songwriter before switching to electronic dance music. He started out creating remixes before producing original tracks, and his first EP was released in 2013. Since then, he‘s released dozens of tracks and remixes, with songs like “I Want You“ and “Age of Innocence“ receiving millions of online streams. His debut full-length, I Am the Elephante, appeared in 2016. “Troubled,“ a collaborative single with singer Deb‘s Daughter, appeared in early 2017.<br></br><a href='https://soundcloud.com/iamtheELEPHANTE'>Soundcloud</a> / <a href='https://instagram.com/iamtheELEPHANTE'>Instagram</a>",

Releases on Zouk Recordings and Spinnin‘ Records followed, and in 2014 Rathbun remixed Michael Jackson‘s “Slave to the Rhythm“ and Bastille‘s “Pompeii,“ the latter of which was heavily played at many clubs and festivals and was eventually nominated for a Grammy for “Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical.“ After completing his first headlining tour in 2015, Audien signed to Astralwerks.

It didn‘t take long for him to find his place in the scene, as Ghastly quickly claimed himself a position as Bassrush Resident DJ at Exchange LA, and has also secured a number of releases on chart-topping labels such as OWSLA, Buygore, and Dim Mak to name a few.<br></br>Ghastly‘s approachable yet hard-hitting style ushers a forward-thinking dynamic that is not often seen in today‘s saturated scene, and his solo productions and collaborations present an unequivocal level of determination and finesse.

In addition to making household names of obscure European bands and labels, he made space in his sets for local Industrial and EBM bands, mostly on fresh-made cassette tape.

Saint has traveled all around the United States DJ’ing, with a highlight being a rare opportunity of spinning two sets at Los Angeles’ legendary Das Bunker in 2013. His DJ’ing has also taken him overseas twice, to DJ at the UK’s premier festival of electronic music - Infest - in 2004 and 2006. He’s been a long-time collaborator with the Something Cold parties (based out of Detroit) and currently host his own monthly night Produkt 313 at Detroit’s UFO Factory. Saint mixes the innovative pioneers with the progressive newcomers, the obscure with the recognizable - all the while perpetually maintaining a technical and inventive rhythmic flow that makes his sets both danceable and moving.",

 "eventDesc" : "The synth pop group Book of Love were dance club staples in the ‘80s. Book of Love formed in Philadelphia, PA, by former art school students Susan Ottaviano (vocals), Ted Ottaviano (keyboards, vocals), Jade Lee (keyboards, vocals), and Lauren Roselli (keyboards, vocals) in 1984. Book of Love‘s self-titled debut LP was released in 1986, and the uplifting “You Make Me Feel So Good“ crossed over onto Top 40 radio. Most of the electronic groups in the mid-‘80s were led by men; Book of Love brought a feminine perspective that was lacking in synthesizer-based music. The band toured with Depeche Mode and Lullaby appeared afterward in 1988. A remix of Mike Oldfield‘s “Tubular Bells (Theme From the Exorcist)“ was another number one smash on the dance charts, while “Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls… courageously addressed the then-taboo subject of AIDS. The group recorded two more albums before splitting up in 1993. A retrospective, I Touch Roses: The Best of Book of Love, was released in 2001. ~ Michael Sutton, Rovi",

Book of Love formed in Philadelphia, PA, by former art school students Susan Ottaviano (vocals), Ted Ottaviano (keyboards, vocals), Jade Lee (keyboards, vocals), and Lauren Roselli (keyboards, vocals) in 1984. (Although they share the same last name, Susan and Ted are not related nor are they married to one another.) Susan, Ted, and Lee had initially collaborated in a band called Head Cheese. In 1985, Book of Love recorded “Boy,“ a toe-tapping tale of teen-girl angst. The song was given to DJ Ivan Ivan, who then forwarded it to Sire Records president Seymour Stein. Impressed, Stein signed Book of Love to the label. “Boy“ became a hit on the college and dance charts, with “I Touch Roses“ subsequently hitting number one on the latter.

Their different backgrounds helped inform Cheat Codes“ stylistically varied sound, which can range from warm pop to outright big house bangers. After the release of ”Visions”, they quickly followed with the tropical-tinged ”Don‘t Say No” (featuring Dresses), ”Senses” (featuring Lostboycrow), and ”Adventure” (featuring Evan Wartner). As they gained exposure on social media and spins on streaming services (over 55 million on Spotify, plus 15 million on YouTube), they joined the Chainsmokers on tour. Successive singles continued to drop into 2016, when they unveiled ”Sex” (featuring Kris Kross Amsterdam), which borrowed the sentiment and chorus from the Salt-N- Pepa classic ”Let‘s Talk About Sex.”",

With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.

She created her own place in the glitch community, thanks to a unique, highly surprising style, mixing powerful basslines, funky off beat percussion and emotional cinematic sounds. A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ. Psymbionic: Cresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound. John Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.",

Born in Miami and then later relocating to Los Angeles, Borger began recording in early 2000s; playing around with various musical styles, he settled on dance music as his preferred genre. His tracks “From Cali with Love,“ “Rags to Riches,“ “GANGSTEROUS,“ and “Aggro“ soon garnered attention from the EDM-oriented community and gave Borger a platform for further releases on the labels Spinnin‘ and Doorn. It was the track “Tsunami“ -- his collaboration with electronic duo DVBBS -- that gained him worldwide recognition. The song was an international smash and led him to perform at major electronic music festivals around the world in 2013. He and DVBBS teamed up with Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike for the single “Stampede“ on Spinnin‘ in late 2013 and he also signed with the label at the same time. In 2014, U.K. rapper Tinie Tempah contributed vocals to “Tsunami“ in an updated remix version of the song. In spring 2014, he released the single “Invincible“ which proved to another popular hit for the producer. - Aneet Nijjar, Rovi via Wikipedia",

After the albums G Spot (1993) and Ginger (1995), as techno developed into a dominating force on many dance floors worldwide, Jochem Paap chose to pursue other exciting avenues. On Public Energy No. 1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) the sound wizard exchanged flowing, harmonious techno for a much more complex formula filled with colliding samples, crackling rhythms and tremendously thrilling turns.<br>Not one to be pigeonholed, over the years he has collaborated with video-artists and filmmakers, making the pioneering DVD Umfeld — an audio-visual electronic trip, which set the standard for many surround-sound composers. Meanwhile his boutique label, Electric Deluxe, has provided a platform for artists to explore more left-field techno projects and experiment with the ever-expanding technological possibilities of modern music making. As an extension of the label its sister event series, Electric Deluxe Presents, has turned Speedy J’s musical vision and penchant for innovation into a premier clubbing experience.<br>Recently the esteemed producer and performer has teamed up with with Stroboscopic Artefacts boss Lucy to form Zeitgeber. In 2013 the pair released their eponymous debut album to critical acclaim.<br>As a DJ, Speedy J is still as busy as ever, touching down in the most important venues and festivals worldwide every weekend. At the same time Electric Deluxe Presents has swelled into a globe-trotting brand with showcases scheduled for various major electronic festivals on the horizon.",
