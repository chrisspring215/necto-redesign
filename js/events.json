Early releases included 2014's “Bloesem“ with De Hofnar and “Hot Skin“ with Kav Verhouzer on the Dutch label Spinnin' Records. After a series of live shows in Europe, which he built over time to contain mostly his own productions, he toured North America for the first time in early 2015. “Midnight Hearts,“ with the Him featuring ANG13, followed soon after, and that spring, Feldt signed with Universal Music for the worldwide release of his song “Show Me Love,“ featuring English vocalist Kimberly Anne. It charted throughout Western Europe, hitting the Top Five in the U.K., as well as landing on the dance and streaming charts in the U.S. By the end of 2015, he'd performed on five continents. The following summer, he had a hit at home with “Summer on You,“ a collaboration with Lucas & Steve and Wulf. That same year, Feldt issued his first EP, Been a While, which featured guests like Dante Klein, Milow, Lulleaux, and Bright Sparks. “Runaways“ with Deepend featuring Teemu followed in late 2016 and charted in Europe, later spawning a remix EP. The next year, Feldtreleased his debut LP, Sunrise, which featured the singles “Yes“ with Akon, “Fade Away“ with Lush & Simon and Inna, and “Be My Lover“ with Alex Schulz. An album of remixes, After the Sunset, arrived in 2018, as did the single “Heaven (Don't Have a Name),“ which featured vocals from actor Jeremy Renner. - Marcy Donelson (Allmusic.com)",

Los Angeles-based DJs Robert Abisi and Nick Shanholtz bonded over a love of electronic music culture and their shared status as recent transplants to L.A. from the East Coast. In 2014, the two began making tracks together as Lost Kings, focusing prominently on remixes of other artists over original compositions. The act almost immediately drew major attention for unofficial remixes of tracks by artists such as Disclosure, the Killers, and Dirty South, gaining enough momentum to sign a management deal. In 2015 they released The Bad EP, followed the next year by companion piece The Good EP. Amid constant touring and ever-growing popularity, Lost Kings began receiving commissions for official remixes for bigger names. The year 2015 saw them reworking Tori Kelly's hit “Should've Been Us“ and 2016 found them releasing an official remix for Rihanna‘s “Work“ single. In addition to wildly successful remix work, Lost Kings also made it to the charts with their own compositions, including “Phone Down“ featuring Emily Warren and early 2017's “Quit You“ featuring Tinashé. They followed with “Look at Us Now“ featuring Ally Brooke and A$AP Ferg and “First Love“ with Sabrina Carpenter. 2018 saw the releases of the singles “When We Were Young,“ featuring Norma Jean Martine, and “Stuck,“ featuring Tove Styrke. - Fred Thomas (Allmusic.com)<br><br><img src='../img/microsurface.jpg'>",

Always finding comfort in music, the Washington DC native began cultivating her eclectic taste music from an early age. It’s been a long, winding road to the top for the spunky Young, who launched her career in 1991 as a hip-hop radio DJ. “I love all kinds of music” the Washington, D.C. born spinstress states.<br><br>At the time, Young had no idea of the heights to which she would rise. “If you told me 10 years later I’d be DJ’ing Madonna’s wedding, I’d say you were crazy!” she laughs. Even from its earliest stages, Young’s musical prowess made people take notice, and it wasn’t long before she translated her work at Interscope Records to a thriving career in the DJ booth that allowed her to bring her one-of-a-kind funk, hip-hop and old-school blend of beats to the masses on eastern corridor airwaves and cable television.<br><br>With a move to Miami came a shift in sound that saw Young injecting her hip-hop roots with the house music thump, that emanated from the South Beach nightclub scene. Under the guise of Miami luminary Ingrid Casares, Young carved a niche for herself, bringing a female presence mainstream to the male-dominated DJ and Production industry.<br><br>Bursting on the gay dance scene, Young’s celebrity and popularity skyrocketed putting her live presence and dance compilation cd’s in great demand.<br><br>It wasn’t only the gay community that was drawn to Young’s magnetic musical pull.Musical legends from Cher to Sean Combs and from Shakira to The Smashing Pumpkins, fell under her spell, booking the disc jockey to spin their exclusive parties. During the historical presidential race, Young was handpicked by Hillary Clinton to DJ a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.<br><br>Through Madonna’s personal endorsement as her “go-to” DJ, Young became a global electronic music celebrity. Her demand grew to an international level as both DJ and Producer. Tracy has released over 7 musical compilations on her own record label FEROSH. She has remixed for over 100 musical artists and has racked up 48 #1 Billboard Club hits including 13 Madonna remixes as well as imaginative electronic reinventions of songs by Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato, Beyonce, Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera, Shakira, Pet Shop Boys and Enrique Iglesias.<br><br>• MUSIC.

In 2009, he released two online mixtapes (Goresteps Most Hated and Ice Cream Mixtape) and an EP (Gorestep, Vol. 1), and appeared on the 12“ EP Viridian released by American label Terminal Dusk. His profile was raised by a spate of 2010 releases that were crude both lyrically and sonically. Ice Cream (featuring “Act Like a Ho“ as a B-side) was issued on Trill Bass and “Birthday and the Black November“ appeared on Audio Freaks, while Borgore Ruined Dubstep and Borgore Ruined Dubstep, Pt. 2 were the first releases on Borger's Buygore label. A fifth Borgore EP, Delicious, was released the following year, while Buygore remained active with other releases from Tomba, Bare, and Bare Noize.</br></br>The Filthiest Hits... So FarBorger released Filthiest Hits...So Far on Sumerian Records in 2011, and mixed the first disc of Ministry of Sound's Sound of Dubstep compilation that year. Another mix album, Borgore's Misadventures in Dubstep, followed on Buygore in 2012. Several EPs/singles appeared on the label that year as well, including “Decisions,“ which featured guest vocalist Miley Cyrus. He continued to churn out releases and remixes during 2013 and 2014, including many singles and EPs for Spinnin' Records and Dim Mak. He collaborated with Waka Flocka Flame on the 2013 single “Wild Out,“ as his style was increasingly becoming more influenced by trap. Borgore's debut production album, #NEWGOREORDER, appeared on Dim Mak in July 2014. The Buygore Album followed early in 2015, and the year found Borgore collaborating with Addison (“School Daze“) and G-Eazy (“Forbes“), in addition to releasing the Keep It Sexy EP. Continued remix commissions, as well as a batch of singles that included the Barrington Levy collaboration “Blast Ya,“ were scattered across 2016.",

Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1989, Wu began playing music at an early age, receiving classical piano training before teaching himself to play guitar. He graduated from Harvard University in 2011 and initially tried to break into the music business as an acoustic singer/songwriter before switching to electronic dance music. He started out creating remixes before producing original tracks, and his first EP was released in 2013. Since then, he's released dozens of tracks and remixes, with songs like “I Want You” and “Age of Innocence” receiving millions of online streams. His debut full-length, I Am the Elephante, appeared in 2016. “Troubled,” a collaborative single with singer Deb's Daughter, appeared in early 2017.",

His skillful, hard-hitting scratch work has rightfully earned him the status of a pioneer in the hip-hop and DJ communities.<br><br>Recently, Mike has been found opening for the Vancouver Winter Olympics, joining the official Emmy’s orchestra with the legendary Michael Bearden (Lady Gaga's/Michael Jackson's music director), creating music that has been featured on major television networks (i.e. producing the theme music for Teen Titans Go on Cartoon Network), performing on Yo Gabba Gabba, producing the theme music for the FIFA World Cup, working on Andra Day's Grammy nominated album, ”Cheers to the Fall”, and more. In 2016, he was invited to the White House by former President Barack Obama to perform at the Kennedy Center Honors 36th Gala honoring Herbie Hancock.<br><br>2017 has been a whirlwind year for Mix Master Mike, touring stadiums with Metallica, trailblazing the VR world, working on music with the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, DJing A$AP Rocky’s latest album release party, and more. Mike’s Virtual Reality project, “Magma Chamber”, has been winning awards internationally, including the 2017 VR Fest Award for “Best Animated VR Music Video” and two awards from Vega Digital Awards. “Magma Chamber” is being recognized as one of the best and most innovative videos in the VR world. As a result of all the attention “Magma Chamber” has received, Sir Richard Branson extended an invitation for Mix Master Mike to attend the Extreme Tech Challenge awards at the famous Necker Island. His second VR music video, “Moonbase Invasion,” was released to critical acclaim as well, winning honors from Cannes Film Festival, Austin Music Video Festival and Globaltrend Video Awards.<br><br>From his early days in the Bay Area until now, Mix Master Mike has always been looking for new ways to create art that challenges the status quo, keeping his brand relevant and exciting for older fans and millennials alike.",

Freddy Todd b2b Esseks with opening sets by Zen Selekta, Spaceship Earth, Gyps$y & 2 Beard Crew.<br><br>Freddy Todd<br>Words will inevitably fail to properly describe Freddy Todd. Genre-busting could be an understatement. You can't pin him down with lexicon like lazer-bass and glitch-funk; these phrases fall way short of capturing the expressiveness, fearlessness, and space-traveling qualities of his music. Hearing his music is akin to being abducted by an extra-terrestrial cruise liner where everyone is tripping on space acid. And if you are lucky enough to witness him produce, you'll see that he fittingly looks just like the captain of said space cruiser, both hands intently gripping his electronics like the instrument panel on the flight deck.<br><br>Esseks<br>Esseks (Sam Eckstein) is a Brooklyn based producer and visual artist. His music ranges all the bass-centric genres with a focus on the off-kilter. The diverse elements of his music are tied together with Esseks’ subtle but instantly recognizable sound. It is dark but in a playful sense. Cartoon Villain music you could say. He has built up a large catalog of music since his first release in 2012 and put out releases with Wakaan (AZ), Gravitas Recordings (TX), Foundations Recordings (CA), and Smokers Cough (NY) along with a number of self releases and collaborations with artists like Yheti, Space Jesus, GDP.

In interviews, the duo referred to their unrepentantly wild style as an attempt to bring fun back into what they felt had become an overly serious hip-hop scene. Overflowing with themes of sex, drugs, and violence, LARS released their Foul World mixtape in late 2017 and offered up debut album Last American Rock Stars early the next year.",

Drama began his career in hip-hop in his native Philadelphia under the name DJ Drama. It was in Philly that he befriended Bahamadia, although he wouldn't become her DJ until he made the move to Atlanta to attend Clark Atlanta University. While at CAU, he also began his popular Automatic Relaxation mixtape series, which focused on neo-soul and soulful rap, plus he formed his crew the Aphilliates, featuring DJ Don Cannon, DJ Jamad, Ox Banger, and DJ Sense. After a short gig as DJ for Slum Village, he began a new mixtape series, Gangsta Grillz, which would become the prime showcase for hardcore artists looking to connect or reconnect with the streets. Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy, and Jim Jones were just a few of the artists to host a volume of Gangsta Grillz, but it was during the making of Vol. 7 that he met his future employer, T.I. As the official DJ of T.I.'s Grand Hustle organization, Drama became better known, and a cameo in the 2006 film ATL didn't hurt either.<br><br>Third Power What did hurt was a January 2007 police raid on the Aphilliates office, which found both Drama and Don Cannon under arrest for racketeering, along with 81,000 mixtape CDs being confiscated. Three months later, legal threats from another DJ Drama forced him to change his name to simply Drama (though it would prove to be only temporary). Despite these legal hassles, Drama took his Gangsta Grillz series aboveground late in the year as the legit release Gangsta Grillz: The Album arrived in December courtesy of Grand Hustle/Atlantic. Lil Wayne, OutKast, Pharrell, T.I., and Young Jeezy were just a few of the artists who contributed to the star-studded album. A second volume followed in 2009. In 2011, Third Power became the first Drama album without the Gangsta Grillz tagging, but the guest list would remain big and powerful, with names like Freddie Gibbs, Wale, and Wiz Khalifa -- the last of whom appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 hit “Oh My” -- all included. Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, and Tyler, the Creator were some of the names that landed on the 2012 follow-up, Quality Street Music. In 2013, Drama let his sense of humor show by hosting the Urbane Outfitters, Vol. 1 mixtape from the online hip-hop comedy team ItsTheReal. A Quality Street Music sequel arrived in 2016. “Wishing,” featuring Chris Brown, Skeme, and Lyquin, became Drama's second single to reach the Hot 100. ~ David Jefferies (allmusic.com)",

Key moments on Enhanced include: “We Belong”, a pivotal 2009 Ferry Corsten rework; the hit-laden 2011 debut album, Piercing the Quiet; and the acclaimed 2013-2014 Metamorphic EP trilogy featuring euphoric favorites “Follow Me Home” and “Now or Never”. “Now or Never” cracked the Top Five on Billboard’s Airplay Dance chart, a placement recaptured by follow-ups, “Anchor”,“Colors”, and “Untouchable”. In a first for the duo, “Now Or Never” also became a sports anthem for CBS’s Thursday Night NFL broadcasts in 2015, introducing the duo to millions of new fans weekly.<br><br>Tritonal’s evolution and success prove that compelling songwriting, innovative production, and exuberant performances resonate with music lovers of all kinds, from underground purists to stadium fanatics.",

After a series of live shows in Europe, which he built over time to contain mostly his own productions, he toured North America for the first time in early 2015. “Midnight Hearts” with the Him featuring ANG13 followed soon after, and that spring, Feldt signed with Universal Music for worldwide release of his song “Show Me Love” featuring English vocalist Kimberly Anne. It charted throughout Western Europe, hitting the Top Five in the U.K., as well as landing on the dance and streaming charts in the U.S. By the end of 2015, he'd performed on five continents. The following summer, he had a hit at home with “Summer on You,” a collaboration with Lucas & Steve and Wulf. That same year, Feldt issued his first EP, Been a While, which featured guests like Dante Klein, Milow, Lulleaux, and Bright Sparks. “Runaways” with Deepend featuring Teemu followed in late 2016 and charted in Europe, later spawning a remix EP. The next year, Feldt released his debut LP, Sunrise, which featured the singles “Yes” with Akon, “Fade Away” with Lush & Simon and Inna, and “Be My Lover” with Alex Schulz. ~ Marcy Donelson (allmusic.com)",

        "eventDescLong": "Electronic duo Pegboard Nerds concocted exuberant future bass fit for dancefloors, bright anime, or kinetic video games (a major influence on their visual aesthetic). Their sound -- a little future bass, a little dubstep, a lot of chiptune -- was the inspired amalgam of Alexander Odden (Norway) and Michael Parsberg-Hansen (Denmark), a pair of producers whose stage name is an anagram of their last names. Starting in 2005, they released a string of EPs and remixes, including a pair of collaborations with Splitbreed. A decade into their pairing, they started a campaign in 2015 called Operation Pink Cloud, aimed at ending breast cancer. The Pink Cloud EP featured guest turns from Max Collins, Johnny Graves, and Jonny Rose. Their fourth EP, Nerds by Nature, arrived in early 2017 and debuted in the Top 15 of Billboard's Electronic Albums chart. ~ Neil Z. Yeung (allmusic.com)",

Light graduated from Ann Arbor’s own University of Michigan and acts as a producer, while Seaver attended The Juilliard School and is the central creative force for the group in his role as producer/songwriter/vocalist.The “Breathe Tour” sets off on a 33-date tour running January-March 2018. The live performances will feature a four-piece band, comprising Seaver on vocals & keys, a guitarist, a violinist and a drummer.Their latest release, “Breathe”, out Friday, December 8, on Ultra Music, signals a reboot in both sound and style. The Mako sound adds percussion-powered layers, indie rock sentiments, airy electronic influences, heartfelt lyrics and a striking vocal performance from Seaver himself.When asked of the inspiration behind the show, Seaver said “I had to switch things up and bring in live musicians. Whenever you take your music to live musicians, they’re not going to play things mathematically. They’re going to play things with a lot of imperfections. You want to create an environment where you make those imperfections exciting, where you can decide something in the moment and have everyone onstage react to it. With the new show, I’m going to dial it up a notch.”",

Known for their viral remixes of “Trap Queen”, “I Miss You” and “Mr. Brightside”, as well as their latest original offerings “Pacific Coast Highway,“ “Emily,“ and “Out Of Love,“ the two have in unprecedented time mastered a wide range of genres from melodic house to harder progressive cuts to pop-leaning earworms. With their Spotify and SoundCloud streams now exceeding 70 million and with twenty-three #1’s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America.</br></br>Kicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Alesso, and Tori Kelly to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct “Soul House” style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release.  After receiving the “Award of Independent Excellence” from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey’s hit “Born To Die” scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014.</br></br>Following multiple performances at San Francisco’s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York’s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Spain, Denmark, The Bahamas, and Mexico, showing off their potential in the international arena.</br></br>With support now coming from the likes of Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and many more, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2017, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.",

In 2007, a more solid lineup came together when Jean Paul‘s brother Alex came on board (producer, keyboards). The musicians spent a summer working inside Jean Paul‘s home studio and emerged with a stack of demos, including a rough cut of the infectious dance number “Party in Your Bedroom.“ They came up with the name Cash Cash in early 2008 and signed with Universal. An Internet and club hit, “Party in Your Bedroom“ also found its way onto their debut release for the label, a self-titled EP that appeared in October. Following the success of that release, they also served as remixers for acts like Krewella, Capital Cities, Kelly Clarkson, and Bruno Mars. Their debut full-length, Take It to the Floor, followed in early 2009 and was supported by a package tour that also included Metro Station and Tyga.<br><br>Overtime Second album Love or Lust appeared in 2011, self-released by the band and featuring a pair of singles, “Victim of Love“ and “Sexin‘ on the Dance Floor“ (the latter featuring Jeffree Starr). They issued the Daft Punk-meets-dubstep single “Michael Jackson (The Beat Goes On)“ in 2012, later included on the EP The Beat Goes On. The band signed to Atlantic‘s Big Beat subsidiary one year later. Their first single for the label, “Take Me Home,“ featuring Bebe Rexha, followed in July 2013. The hit was part of the Overtime EP, which also featured Kerli on the track “Here and Now.“ The following year, Cash Cash nabbed head Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik for the single “Lightning.“ “Surrender“ arrived the year later with American singer Julia Michaels on vocals. These songs would later feature on their fourth LP -- and first for Big Beat -- Blood, Sweat & 3 Years. The 2016 release featured additional contributions from artists such as Busta Rhymes, Fitz & the Tantrums, Nelly, Christina Perri, and more. The following year, Cash Cash issued the stand-alone single “Matches,“ with singer Rozes. ~ David Jeffries (Allmusic.com)<br><br>Make sure to checkout our other <a href='halloween-events-michigan-2017.html'>Halloween 2017 Events!</a>",

Previous tours stops have been absolutely killer, packing the venues with infectious dance music, and it's sure to be a zoo on Thursday.<br></br>Elephante is the recording and performing moniker of Tim Wu, a Los Angeles-based EDM DJ/producer known for his big-room progressive house anthems and remixes of artists ranging from Clean Bandit to Lorde. He generally tends to produce pop-leaning vocal dance tracks, but he dips into slower, trap-inspired numbers as well. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1989, Wu began playing music at an early age, receiving classical piano training before teaching himself to play guitar. He graduated from Harvard University in 2011 and initially tried to break into the music business as an acoustic singer/songwriter before switching to electronic dance music. He started out creating remixes before producing original tracks, and his first EP was released in 2013. Since then, he‘s released dozens of tracks and remixes, with songs like “I Want You“ and “Age of Innocence“ receiving millions of online streams. His debut full-length, I Am the Elephante, appeared in 2016. “Troubled,“ a collaborative single with singer Deb‘s Daughter, appeared in early 2017.<br></br><a href='https:soundcloud.com/iamtheELEPHANTE'>Soundcloud</a> / <a href='https:instagram.com/iamtheELEPHANTE'>Instagram</a>",

Rathbun started creating tracks in 2008, initially releasing happy hardcore on Only Vibes Recordings, a digital label he co-founded with producer Naggy. Rathbun switched to trance in 2009, sending a demo to Ferry Corsten, who released “Rise & Shine“ on his Aleph Recordings imprint. Numerous singles followed on labels like Songbird, First State Music, Enhanced Progressive, and Perceptive Deep, and leading progressive house DJs such as Tiësto, Above & Beyond, and Armin van Buuren began to take notice of Audien‘s euphoric sound, leading to an opening slot for van Buuren at the Roseland in New York City in 2011. He released tracks on Anjunabeats and Trice Recordings in 2012, and toured the United States with Hardwell soon after. Releases on Zouk Recordings and Spinnin‘ Records followed, and in 2014 Rathbun remixed Michael Jackson‘s “Slave to the Rhythm“ and Bastille‘s “Pompeii,“ the latter of which was heavily played at many clubs and festivals and was eventually nominated for a Grammy for “Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical.“ After completing his first headlining tour in 2015, Audien signed to Astralwerks. The label promptly released “Insomnia,“ which topped Billboard‘s dance music chart. This was followed by the release of “Something Better,“ a collaboration with country superstars Lady Antebellum. Two more major singles followed, “Crazy Love“ (featuring Deb‘s Daughter) in 2016, and “One More Weekend“ (with MAX) in 2017.",

(Although they share the same last name, Susan and Ted are not related nor are they married to one another.) Susan, Ted, and Lee had initially collaborated in a band called Head Cheese. In 1985, Book of Love recorded “Boy,“ a toe-tapping tale of teen-girl angst. The song was given to DJ Ivan Ivan, who then forwarded it to Sire Records president Seymour Stein. Impressed, Stein signed Book of Love to the label. “Boy“ became a hit on the college and dance charts, with “I Touch Roses“ subsequently hitting number one on the latter. ~ Michael Sutton, Rovi",

Hello Fascination was released in 2009 and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard 200, and in 2011 the group released their third full-length, Hell Is What You Make It. ",

She created her own place in the glitch community, thanks to a unique, highly surprising style, mixing powerful basslines, funky off beat percussion and emotional cinematic sounds. A musical identity which led her to play in the USA (including the festivals Coachella, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala...), Canada, India, Berlin, and more than 30 cities in France, alongside artists like Bonobo, Gramatik, Chet Faker, Tipper, TOKiMONSTA, Tipper, Big Gigantic, GRiZ. Psymbionic: Cresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound. John Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.",
